                    <p class="msg">

                    <p class="msg">
                        The OSCAL product line is planned to include the rugged outdoor phone series that Blackview has been so famous for.

                    <p class="msg">
                        As a new brand from the same family, OSCAL shares the same R&D strength and QC power with Blackview. In the initial planning, OSCAL has overlapping product lines with Blackview but mainly targets young people. From this perspective, OSCAL distinguishes itself from Blackview with a different vision. Awaiting for OSCAL is a dynamic and promising journey that is full of many variables. What is certain for OSCAL is that it will be a friendly brand with friendly priced quality products for everyone. Stay tuned!                    </p>

                                        It is common to see famous phones brands roll out a sub-brand to cover more
                                        users, expand market share and improve their competitiveness. For example,
                                        Xiaomi had the Redmi sub-brand and Huawei launched the Honor sub-brand. And
                                        recently, the well-known outdoor rugged phone brand Blackview has also
                                        announced that it will soon internationally establish a sub-brand called
                                        OSCAL.
