                    6 Reasons Why You'll Love Tab 9

                    Hi guys,
                </p>
                <p class="msg" style="margin: 1vw 0;">
                    The main purpose of a tablet for me is to spend one or two hours a day on the entertainment like
                    listening music, playing games, watching movies or reading novels and most tablets cover the needs.
                    I am more picky about the price and the design when choosing a tablet, for which I select the Tab 9,
                    expecting less from its performance. However, it quickly gets me from all aspects.
                </p>
                <p class="msg" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;margin: 1vw 0;">
                    1.Sleek Design
                </p>
                <p class="msg" style="margin: 1vw 0;">
                    I love its appearance at the first sight and it becomes one of the decisive factors to choose this
                    tablet. Tab 9 gives a perfect fusion of style and comfort. It's 8.8mm thin and very comfortable to
                    hold. The brushed aluminum unibody with nicely-curved edges makes it look more elegant while
                    ensuring the sturdiness. I can confidently say that the design is no less than other famous tablets.
                </p>

                    2.10.1-inch Display with Dual Speakers
                </p>
                <p class="msg" style="margin: 1vw 0;">
                    The 10.1-inch display with narrow bezels enlarges the field of vision. 1920*1200 FHD resolution
                    shows clear and vivid details. It's a great feast for my eyes when watching movies or live video
                    streaming on such an excellent screen. When playing games, it easily gets me into the tense and
                    thrilling atmosphere and I am fully immersive with the sight, sound and motion, which I have never
                    had before.

                    3.7480mAh Large-capacity Battery
                </p>
                <p class="msg" style="margin: 1vw 0;">
                    This tablet really surprises me with a long battery life as few tablets can be equipped with such a
                    high-capacity battery. Most tablets are powered by 4000 to 6000mAh battery. It's said to easily
                    support 6 hours of video, 6 hours of game and 7.5 hours of web browsing but I haven't tested it
                    specifically. Anyway, it's powerful enough to keep powered all day. I always use it to watch news or
                    read books when commuting. It takes several days for the next charging. No more need to carry
                    charging cables often on the go.
                </p>

                    4.Excellent Octa-core Processor
                </p>
                <p class="msg" style="margin: 1vw 0;">
                    Tab 9 is powered by an octa-core Spreadtrum T610 processor which can nearly compare the high-end
                    processors of Apple, Samsung and Huawei tablets and it improves the CPU and GPU performance by 20%.
                    And thanks to this processor, it's faster and smoother to play games than ever before. I can start
                    up several work & play apps and switch among them swiftly. Unlike my previous tablet, I don't need
                    to close some apps to smoothly run others.

                    5.Smart Doke_P 1.0 OS
                </p>
                <p class="msg" style="margin: 1vw 0;">
                    The Doke_P 1.0 OS is developed based on Android 10. I get clean and clear interface with the
                    optimized app icons and better menu spacing to view easily. It allows for more customized setting
                    like adjusting the color and temperature. The system manager provides a smart control over trash
                    cleaning, battery performance, gaming boosting, and how apps run in the background. Simple and
                    smooth, it always satisfies my needs for both work and play.

                    6.Friendly Pricing
                </p>
                <p class="msg" style="margin: 1vw 0;">
                    This Tab 9 is available at a stunningly low price. I got this tablet at $149.99 (original price
                    $199.99) during its promotion period. This price is fairly lower than the Apple, samsung and Huawei
                    tablets but I can enjoy the comparable performance with these brands. It's well-known that you get
                    what you pay for but it's not workable on this tablet. Actually, it's the opposite.
