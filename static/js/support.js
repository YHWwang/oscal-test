      1.The mobile phone running high-power applications (such as demanding games) will generate heat. If it is overheated, please pause it for a while before using it.<br>
      2.The heat dissipation effect of the mobile phone with the metal bottom case is higher than that with the plastic bottom case, so in general, the temperature of the metal bottom case will be higher than that of the plastic bottom case. The phone with metal bottom case will radiate the heat through the case and it heats up and dissipates quickly. If you find heat generation during use, it is recommended to clean the background of the phone and then let it stand for a period of time before running. If the temperature is high and you are worried, you can directly shut down the phone and place it on the cool and ventilate places like the floor for heat dissipation.<br>
      3.The phone will be very hot when it is running for a long time. At this time, you need to close some running apps (such as games, videos, music, etc.)<br>
      4.Remember not to use the mobile phone when charging, let alone charging while talking, because playing while charging can cause great damage to the battery, and the heat emitted by the phone at this time is much higher than the heat emitted during normal use.<br>
      5.Using the mobile phone under the sun or on a quilt will cause more heat than normal. Under the sun, the heat will be absorbed by the phone; on a quilt, it’s easy to generate accumulated temperature and cause heat.

      Please perform the steps below to troubleshoot:
1.Check the network conditions
If this issue occurs when using an audio or video player, use a similar app and check whether the issue persists.
If the issue does not occur again, the server of the app in question may not be responding promptly, or there may be an issue with the audio or video file itself. It is recommended that you switch to a lower image quality or sound quality, or update the app to the latest version and try again. If the issue persists, report the issue to the app's customer service.
If all apps requiring an Internet connection fail to run smoothly, check whether your Mobile data network or Wi-Fi signal is sufficiently strong. If not, connect your device to a network with a stronger signal. Or alternatively, enable Airplane mode, wait for a short while and disable it, and then try again.
You can also reset the network settings and try again.
2.Clean up storage space
If your device's RAM or storage space is insufficient, the app may freeze while being used. Go to System Manager((Via OTA to update) and clean your device's storage space.
3.Clear background apps
If this issue occurs when a large number of apps are running in the background, close the apps that you are not using and try again.`

      What is TalkBack?
      TalkBack is an Android service that gives spoken feedback and notifications for users with visual impairments. With TalkBack enabled, your device will automatically read the content you touch, select, and activate. While TalkBack is enabled, you will be able to navigate across your device in a significantly different way from the regular mode.
      The voice feedback provided by TalkBack is determined by the language engine pre-installed in the system. This means that voice feedback may not be available for all languages.
      Enable TalkBack
      Go to Settings > Accessibility, and enable TalkBack.
      If Talkback or Screen Reader is not enabled on your device, your device does not support this function.

      You are advised to perform all Bluetooth operations while keeping your headphones within a 10 meter radius from your other Bluetooth device(s).
