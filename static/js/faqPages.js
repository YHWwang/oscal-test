      1.The mobile phone running high-power applications (such as demanding games) will generate heat. If it is overheated, please pause it for a while before using it.<br><br>
      2.The heat dissipation effect of the mobile phone with the metal bottom case is higher than that with the plastic bottom case, so in general, the temperature of the metal bottom case will be higher than that of the plastic bottom case. The phone with metal bottom case will radiate the heat through the case and it heats up and dissipates quickly. If you find heat generation during use, it is recommended to clean the background of the phone and then let it stand for a period of time before running. If the temperature is high and you are worried, you can directly shut down the phone and place it on the cool and ventilate places like the floor for heat dissipation.<br><br>
      3.The phone will be very hot when it is running for a long time. At this time, you need to close some running apps (such as games, videos, music, etc.)<br><br>
      4.Remember not to use the mobile phone when charging, let alone charging while talking, because playing while charging can cause great damage to the battery, and the heat emitted by the phone at this time is much higher than the heat emitted during normal use.<br><br>
      5.Using the mobile phone under the sun or on a quilt will cause more heat than normal. Under the sun, the heat will be absorbed by the phone; on a quilt, it’s easy to generate accumulated temperature and cause heat.

If the issue persists, report the issue to the app's customer service.<br><br>
*If all apps requiring an Internet connection fail to run smoothly, check whether your Mobile data network or Wi-Fi signal is sufficiently strong. If not, connect your device to a network with a stronger signal. Or alternatively, enable Airplane mode, wait for a short while and disable it, and then try again.<br><br>
You can also reset the network settings and try again.<br><br>
2.Clean up storage space<br><br>
*If your device's RAM or storage space is insufficient, the app may freeze while being used. Go to System Manager((Via OTA to update) and clean your device's storage space.<br><br>
3.Clear background apps<br><br>
